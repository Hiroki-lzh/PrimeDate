[Summary]
I had to find out "PrimeDate" from a certain reason.
"PrimeDate" is a prime number of the day that represented in the form of YYYYMMDD.
  For example:
	date:2016/06/11 -> Number 20160611 is prime, so this day is "PrimeDate".
	date:2016/06/10 -> Number 20160611 is not prime, so this day is not "PrimeDate".

[How to use]

$ perl PrimeDate.pl -y <YEAR>
  For example:
	$ perl PrimeDate.pl -y 2016
